v1.1: No SD card or thermocouples. Very simple, low-density, "agricultural" PCB layout, which can easily be made single-sided and is well suited to DIY PCB fabrication. Even inexperienced persons should be able to easily make a working board, using photolithography, toner transfer, or CNC milling techniques.

v2.2: "Official" production version. Includes three thermocouple interfaces and micro-SD card. Micro-SD card socket is the Amphenol 101-00660-68-6.

v2.2: Changed to the same micro-SD card PCB footprint as the Kliment SDRamps board, using some generic micro-SD card socket from eBay.
